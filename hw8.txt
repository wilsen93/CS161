1)
b)
P(disease = yes) >= 0.008942
P(test = positive | disease = no) <= 0.002219
 
2)
Variables:
Battery: OK, Dead
DogBowelTrouble: Yes, No
Expecting Guests: Yes, No
Family Home: Yes, No
LightSensorHealth: OK, Broken
SoundSensorHealth: OK, Broken

DogBarking: Yes, No
DogOutside: Yes, No
HearableBarking: Yes, No
OutdoorLight: On, Off

LightSensor: On, Off
SoundSensor: On, Off

Causal structure:

ExpectingGuests->OutdoorLight
FamilyHome->OutdoorLight
FamilyHome->DogOutside
DogBowelTrouble->DogOutside
DogOutside->DogBarking
DogBarking->HearableBarking
OutdoorLight->LightSensor
LightSensorHealth->LightSensor
Battery->LightSensor
Battery->SoundSensor
HearableBarking->SoundSensor
SoundSensorHealth->SoundSensor

a)
I tried setting OutdoorLight = On, HearableBarking = No.
I obtain the following results

Battery = OK
DogBarking = No
DogBowelTrouble = Yes
DogOutside = No
ExpectingGuests = No
FamilyHome = No
LightSensor = On
LightSensorHealth = OK
SoundSensor = Off
SoundSensorHealth = OK

P(mpe,e) = 0.1175
P(mpe|e) = 0.4379

b)
I tried setting FamilyHome = Yes, ExpectingGuests = No.
I obtain the following results

Battery = OK
DogBarking = Yes
DogBowelTrouble = Yes
DogOutside = Yes
HearableBarking = Yes 
LightSensorHealth = OK
SoundSensorHealth = OK
LightSensor = Off
SoundSensor = On
OutdoorLight = Off

P(mpe,e) = 0.0682
P(mpe|e) = 0.2558

c)
Given Z={FamilyHome,Battery}, LightSensor and SoundSensor are independent
as they are d-separated

d)
It is a multiply-connected tree
